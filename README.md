# Bob
###### A distant relative of Eliza - so we think.

Bob is a chatbot built using very similar principles to that of ELIZA (Weizenbaum J., 1966 [1]) in combination with the use of a Markov chain, trained on a corpus of input text, for added interest.

# Running Bob

Bob is written in python 2, so run `main.py` using `python2`, if you have it.
